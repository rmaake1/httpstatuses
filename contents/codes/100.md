The 100 (Continue) status code indicates that the initial part of a request has
been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The server intends to
send a final response after the request has been fully received and acted upon.

When the request contains an Expect header field that includes a 100-continue
expectation, the 100 response indicates that the server wishes to receive the
request payload body, as described in
[RFC7231 Section 5.1.1][2]. The
client ought to continue sending the request and discard the 100 response.

If the request did not contain an Expect header field containing the
100-continue expectation, the client can simply discard this interim response.
