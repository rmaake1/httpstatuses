The initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been rejected by
the server. The server intends to send a final response after the request has
been fully received and acted upon.

When the request contains an Expect header field that includes a 100-continue
expectation, the 100 response indicates that the server wishes to receive the
request payload body<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. The client ought to continue sending
the request and discard the 100 response.

If the request did not contain an Expect header field containing the
100-continue expectation, the client can simply discard this interim response.
