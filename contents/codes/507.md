The 507 (Insufficient Storage) status code means the method could not be
performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the
representation needed to successfully complete the request.  This condition is
considered to be temporary. If the request that received this status code was
the result of a user action, the request MUST NOT be repeated until it is
requested by a separate user action.
