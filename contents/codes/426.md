The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.

The server MUST send an Upgrade header field in a 426 response to indicate the required protocol(s)<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Example:

```plain
HTTP/1.1 426 Upgrade Required
Upgrade: HTTP/3.0
Connection: Upgrade
Content-Length: 53
Content-Type: text/plain

This service requires use of the HTTP/3.0 protocol.
```
