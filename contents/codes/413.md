---

The 413 (Payload Too Large) status code indicates that the server is refusing
to process a request because the request payload is larger than the server is
willing or able to process. The server MAY close the connection to prevent the
client from continuing the request.

If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD generate a Retry-After header
field to indicate that it is temporary and after what time the client MAY try
again.
