The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.

The primary resource created by the request is identified by either a Location header field in the response or, if no Location field is received, by the effective request URI.

The 201 response payload typically describes and links to the resource(s) created. See [Section 7.2 of RFC7231][2] for a discussion of the meaning and purpose of validator header fields, such as ETag and Last-Modified, in a 201 response.
