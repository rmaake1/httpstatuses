The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.

Clients receiving a 421 Misdirected Request response from a server MAY retry the request -- whether the request method is idempotent or not -- over a different connection. This is possible if a connection is reused<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>or if an alternative service is selected [ALT-SVC][3].

This status code MUST NOT be generated by proxies.

A 421 response is cacheable by default, i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>.
