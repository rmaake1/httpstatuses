The 421 Misdirected Request status code indicates that the request was
directed at a server that is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by
a server that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of
scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.

Clients receiving a 421 (Misdirected Request) response from a server MAY retry
the request -- whether the request method is idempotent or not -- over a
different connection. This is possible if a connection is reused
([RFC7540 Section 9.1.1][2]) or if an alternative service is selected
[ALT-SVC][3].

This status code MUST NOT be generated by proxies.

A 421 response is cacheable by default, i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls
(see [Section 4.2.2 of RFC7234][4]).
