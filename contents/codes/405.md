The 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code indicates that the method received in
the request-line is known by the origin server but not supported by the target
resource. The origin server MUST generate an Allow header field in a 405
response containing a list of the target resource's currently supported methods.

A 405 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls (see [Section 4.2.2 of RFC7234][2]).
