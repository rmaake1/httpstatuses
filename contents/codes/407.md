---

The 407 Proxy Authentication Required status code is similar to
[401 (Unauthorized)](/401), but it indicates that the client needs to
authenticate itself in order to use a proxy.

The proxy MUST send a Proxy-Authenticate header field ([Section 4.3][2])
containing a challenge applicable to that proxy for the target resource.
The client MAY repeat the request with a new or replaced Proxy-Authorization
header field ([Section 4.4][3]).
