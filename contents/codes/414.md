title: Request-URI Too Long

---

The 414 (URI Too Long) status code indicates that the server is refusing to
service the request because the request-target ([Section 5.3 of RFC7230][2]) is
longer than the server is willing to interpret. This rare condition is only
likely to occur when a client has improperly converted a POST request to a GET
request with long query information, when the client has descended into a "black
hole" of redirection (e.g., a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of
itself) or when the server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit
potential security holes.

A 414 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the
method definition or explicit cache controls
(see [Section 4.2.2 of RFC7234][3]).
