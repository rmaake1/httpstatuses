The 503 Service Unavailable status code indicates that the server is currently
unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or scheduled
maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after some delay.

The server MAY send a Retry-After header field ([RFC7231 Section 7.1.3][2]) to
suggest an appropriate amount of time for the client to wait before retrying the
request.

Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a server has to
use it when becoming overloaded. Some servers might simply refuse the
connection.
