The server is successfully fulfilling a range request for the target
resource by transferring one or more parts of the selected
representation that correspond to the satisfiable ranges found in the
request's Range header field<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

If a single part is being transferred, the server generating the 206
response MUST generate a Content-Range header field, describing what
range of the selected representation is enclosed, and a payload
consisting of the range. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1
206 Partial Content
Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT
Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT
Content-Range: bytes 21010-47021/47022
Content-Length: 26012
Content-Type: image/gif

... 26012 bytes of partial image data ...
```

If multiple parts are being transferred, the server generating the 206
response MUST generate a "multipart/byteranges"
payload<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>, and a Content-Type header field
containing the multipart/byteranges media type and its required boundary
parameter. To avoid confusion with single-part responses, a server MUST
NOT generate a Content-Range header field in the HTTP header section of
a multiple part response (this field will be sent in each part instead).

Within the header area of each body part in the multipart payload, the
server MUST generate a Content-Range header field corresponding to the
range being enclosed in that body part. If the selected representation
would have had a Content-Type header field in a [200 OK](/200) response,
the server SHOULD generate that same Content-Type field in the header
area of each body part. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1
206 Partial Content
Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT
Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT
Content-Length: 1741
Content-Type: multipart/byteranges; boundary=THIS_STRING_SEPARATES

--THIS_STRING_SEPARATES
Content-Type: application/pdf
Content-Range: bytes 500-999/8000

...the first range...
--THIS_STRING_SEPARATES
Content-Type: application/pdf
Content-Range: bytes 7000-7999/8000

...the second range
--THIS_STRING_SEPARATES--
```

When multiple ranges are requested, a server MAY coalesce any of the
ranges that overlap, or that are separated by a gap that is smaller than
the overhead of sending multiple parts, regardless of the order in which
the corresponding byte-range-spec appeared in the received Range header
field. Since the typical overhead between parts of a
multipart/byteranges payload is around 80 bytes, depending on the
selected representation's media type and the chosen boundary parameter
length, it can be less efficient to transfer many small disjoint parts
than it is to transfer the entire selected representation.

A server MUST NOT generate a multipart response to a request for a
single range, since a client that does not request multiple parts might
not support multipart responses. However, a server MAY generate a
multipart/byteranges payload with only a single body part if multiple
ranges were requested and only one range was found to be satisfiable or
only one range remained after coalescing. A client that cannot process a
multipart/byteranges response MUST NOT generate a request that asks for
multiple ranges.

When a multipart response payload is generated, the server SHOULD send
the parts in the same order that the corresponding byte-range-spec
appeared in the received Range header field, excluding those ranges that
were deemed unsatisfiable or that were coalesced into other ranges. A
client that receives a multipart response MUST inspect the Content-Range
header field present in each body part in order to determine which range
is contained in that body part; a client cannot rely on receiving the
same ranges that it requested, nor the same order that it requested.

When a 206 response is generated, the server MUST generate the following
header fields, in addition to those required above, if the field would
have been sent in a [200 OK](/200) response to the same request: Date,
Cache-Control, ETag, Expires, Content-Location, and Vary.

If a 206 is generated in response to a request with an If-Range header
field, the sender SHOULD NOT generate other representation header fields
beyond those required above, because the client is understood to already
have a prior response containing those header fields. Otherwise, the
sender MUST generate all of the representation header fields that would
have been sent in a [200 OK](/200) response to the same request.

A 206 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
by explicit cache controls<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>.
