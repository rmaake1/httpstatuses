The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future
references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.

Clients with link-editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link
references to the effective request URI to one or more of the new
references sent by the server, where possible.

The server SHOULD generate a Location header field in the response
containing a preferred URI reference for the new permanent URI. The user
agent MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection. The
server's response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a
hyperlink to the new URI(s).

Note: For historical reasons, a user agent MAY change the request method
from POST to GET for the subsequent request. If this behavior is
undesired, the [307 Temporary Redirect](/307) status code can be used
instead.

A 301 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
by the method definition or explicit cache
