The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication
credentials for the target resource.

The server generating a 401 response MUST send a WWW-Authenticate header
field<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> containing at least one challenge applicable
to the target resource.

If the request included authentication credentials, then the 401
response indicates that authorization has been refused for those
credentials. The user agent MAY repeat the request with a new or
replaced Authorization header field<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>. If the 401
response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user
agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the user
agent SHOULD present the enclosed representation to the user, since it
usually contains relevant diagnostic information.
