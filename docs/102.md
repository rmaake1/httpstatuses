An interim response used to inform the client that the server has
accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it.

This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable
expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As
guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable,
but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102
(Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the
request has been completed.

Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process,
especially methods that support the Depth header. In such cases the
client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response. To
prevent this the server may return a 102 Processing status code to
indicate to the client that the server is still processing the method.
