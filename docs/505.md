The server does not support, or refuses to support, the major version of
HTTP that was used in the request message.

The server is indicating that it is unable or unwilling to complete the
request using the same major version as the client, as described in
[Section 2.6 of RFC7230][2], other than with this error message. The
server SHOULD generate a representation for the 505 response that
describes why that version is not supported and what other protocols are
supported by that server.
