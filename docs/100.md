The initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been
rejected by the server. The server intends to send a final response
after the request has been fully received and acted upon.

When the request contains an Expect header field that includes a
100-continue expectation, the 100 response indicates that the server
wishes to receive the request payload body<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>. The
client ought to continue sending the request and discard the 100
response.

If the request did not contain an Expect header field containing the
100-continue expectation, the client can simply discard this interim
response.
