The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current
state of the target resource. This code is used in situations where the
user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request.

The server SHOULD generate a payload that includes enough information
for a user to recognize the source of the conflict.

Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For
example, if versioning were being used and the representation being PUT
included changes to a resource that conflict with those made by an
earlier (third-party) request, the origin server might use a 409
response to indicate that it can't complete the request. In this case,
the response representation would likely contain information useful for
merging the differences based on the revision history.
