Used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid enumerating the
internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly.

For each binding to a collection inside the request's scope, only one
will be reported with a 200 status, while subsequent DAV:response
elements for all other bindings will use the 208 status, and no
DAV:response elements for their descendants are included.

Note that the 208 status will only occur for "Depth: infinity" requests,
and that it is of particular importance when the multiple collection
bindings cause a bind loop<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

A client can request the DAV:resource-id property in a PROPFIND request
to guarantee that they can accurately reconstruct the binding structure
of a collection with multiple bindings to a single resource.

For backward compatibility with clients not aware of the 208 status code
appearing in multistatus response bodies, it SHOULD NOT be used unless
the client has signaled support for this specification using the "DAV"
request header<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>. Instead, a
[508 Loop Detected](/508) status should be returned when a binding loop
is discovered. This allows the server to return the 508 as the top-level
return status, if it discovers it before it started the response, or in
the middle of a multistatus, if it discovers it in the middle of
streaming out a multistatus response.
