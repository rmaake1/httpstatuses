The request has succeeded.

The payload sent in a 200 response depends on the request method. For
the methods defined by this specification, the intended meaning of the
payload can be summarized as:

* `GET` a representation of the target resource
* `HEAD` the same representation as `GET`, but without the
  representation data
* `POST` a representation of the status of, or results obtained from,
  the action;
  * `PUT` `DELETE` a representation of the status of the action;
  * `OPTIONS` a representation of the communications options;
  * `TRACE` a representation of the request message as received by the
  end server.

Aside from responses to CONNECT, a 200 response always has a payload,
though an origin server MAY generate a payload body of zero length. If
no payload is desired, an origin server ought to send
[204 No Content](/204) instead. For CONNECT, no payload is allowed
because the successful result is a tunnel, which begins immediately
after the 200 response header section.

A 200 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
by the method definition or explicit cache
