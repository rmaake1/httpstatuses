The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the
response is a representation of the result of one or more
instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.

The actual current instance might not be available except by combining
this response with other previous or future responses, as appropriate
for the specific instance-manipulation(s). If so, the headers of the
resulting instance are the result of combining the headers from the 226
response and the other instances, following the rules in
[section 13.5.3][2] of the HTTP/1.1 specification.

The request MUST have included an A-IM header field listing at least one
instance-manipulation. The response MUST include an Etag header field
giving the entity tag of the current instance.

A response received with a status code of 226 MAY be stored by a cache
and used in reply to a subsequent request, subject to the HTTP
expiration mechanism and any Cache-Control headers, and to the
requirements in [section 10.6][3].

A response received with a status code of 226 MAY be used by a cache, in
conjunction with a cache entry for the base instance, to create a cache
entry for the current instance.
