title: Too Many Requests
references:
    "Symfony HTTP Status Constant": "Response::HTTP_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS"
---

The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate
limiting").

The response representations SHOULD include details explaining the
condition, and MAY include a Retry-After header indicating how long to
wait before making a new request.

For example:

``` HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests Content-Type: text/html Retry-After:
3600

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Too Many Requests</title> </head> <body>
    <h1>Too Many Requests</h1> <p>I only allow 50 requests per hour to
    this Web site per logged in user. Try again soon.</p>
  </body> </html> ```

Note that this specification does not define how the origin server
identifies the user, nor how it counts requests. For example, an origin
server that is limiting request rates can do so based upon counts of
requests on a per-resource basis, across the entire server, or even
among a set of servers. Likewise, it might identify the user by its
authentication credentials, or a stateful cookie.

Responses with the 429 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.
