title: Request Header Fields Too Large
references:
    "Symfony HTTP Status Constant": "Response::HTTP_REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE"
---

The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields
are too large. The request MAY be resubmitted after reducing the size of
the request header fields.

It can be used both when the set of request header fields in total is
too large, and when a single header field is at fault. In the latter
case, the response representation SHOULD specify which header field was
too large.

For example:

``` HTTP/1.1 431 Request Header Fields Too Large Content-Type: text/html

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Request Header Fields Too Large</title> </head> <body>
    <h1>Request Header Fields Too Large</h1> <p>The "Example" header was
    too large.</p>
  </body> </html> ```

Responses with the 431 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.
