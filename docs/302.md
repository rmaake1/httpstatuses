The target resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the
redirection might be altered on occasion, the client ought to continue
to use the effective request URI for future requests.

The server SHOULD generate a Location header field in the response
containing a URI reference for the different URI. The user agent MAY use
the Location field value for automatic redirection. The server's
response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a
hyperlink to the different URI(s).

Note: For historical reasons, a user agent MAY change the request method
from POST to GET for the subsequent request. If this behavior is
undesired, the [307 Temporary Redirect](/307) status code can be used
instead.
