The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary
overload or scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after
some delay.

The server MAY send a Retry-After header field<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> to
suggest an appropriate amount of time for the client to wait before
retrying the request.

Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a server
has to use it when becoming overloaded. Some servers might simply refuse
the connection.
