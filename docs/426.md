---

The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but
might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different
protocol.

The server MUST send an Upgrade header field in a 426 response to
indicate the required protocol(s)<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>

Example:

``` HTTP/1.1 426 Upgrade Required Upgrade: HTTP/3.0 Connection: Upgrade
Content-Length: 53 Content-Type: text/plain

This service requires use of the HTTP/3.0 protocol. ```
