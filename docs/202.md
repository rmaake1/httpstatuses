The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not
been completed. The request might or might not eventually be acted upon,
as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place.

There is no facility in HTTP for re-sending a status code from an
asynchronous operation.

The 202 response is intentionally noncommittal. Its purpose is to allow
a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a
batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without requiring
that the user agent's connection to the server persist until the process
is completed. The representation sent with this response ought to
describe the request's current status and point to (or embed) a status
monitor that can provide the user with an estimate of when the request
will be fulfilled.
