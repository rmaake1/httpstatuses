The server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a legal
demand.

The server in question might not be an origin server. This type of legal
demand typically most directly affects the operations of ISPs and search
engines.

Responses using this status code SHOULD include an explanation, in the
response body, of the details of the legal demand: the party making it,
the applicable legislation or regulation, and what classes of person and
resource it applies to. For example:

``` HTTP/1.1 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons Link:
<https://spqr.example.org/legislatione>; rel="blocked-by" Content-Type:
text/html

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Unavailable For Legal Reasons</title> </head> <body>
    <h1>Unavailable For Legal Reasons</h1> <p>This request may not be
    serviced in the Roman Province of Judea due to the Lex Julia
    Majestatis, which disallows access to resources hosted on servers
    deemed to be operated by the People's Front of Judea.</p>
  </body> </html> ```

The use of the 451 status code implies neither the existence nor non-
existence of the resource named in the request. That is to say, it is
possible that if the legal demands were removed, a request for the
resource still might not succeed.

Note that in many cases clients can still access the denied resource by
using technical countermeasures such as a VPN or the Tor network.

A 451 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
by the method definition or explicit cache controls; see [RFC7234][2].
