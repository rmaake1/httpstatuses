title: Misdirected Request
references:
    "Rails HTTP Status Symbol": ":misdirected_request"
---

The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a
response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce
responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are included
in the request URI.

Clients receiving a 421 Misdirected Request response from a server MAY
retry the request -- whether the request method is idempotent or not --
over a different connection. This is possible if a connection is
reused<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>or if an alternative service is selected
[ALT-SVC][3].

This status code MUST NOT be generated by proxies.

A 421 response is cacheable by default, i.e., unless otherwise indicated
by the method definition or explicit cache
controls<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>.
