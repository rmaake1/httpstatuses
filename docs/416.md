None of the ranges in the request's Range header
field<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup> overlap the current extent of the selected
resource or that the set of ranges requested has been rejected due to
invalid ranges or an excessive request of small or overlapping ranges.

For byte ranges, failing to overlap the current extent means that the
first-byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than
the current length of the selected representation. When this status code
is generated in response to a byte-range request, the sender SHOULD
generate a Content-Range header field specifying the current length of
the selected representation<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>.

For example:

``` HTTP/1.1 416 Range Not Satisfiable Date: Fri, 20 Jan 2012 15:41:54
GMT Content-Range: bytes */47022 ```

Note: Because servers are free to ignore Range, many implementations
will simply respond with the entire selected representation in a
[200 OK](/200) response. That is partly because most clients are
prepared to receive a [200 OK](/200) to complete the task (albeit less
efficiently) and partly because clients might not stop making an invalid
partial request until they have received a complete representation.
Thus, clients cannot depend on receiving a 416 Range Not Satisfiable
response even when it is most appropriate.
