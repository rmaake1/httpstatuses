The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.

A server that wishes to make public why the request has been forbidden
can describe that reason in the response payload (if any).

If authentication credentials were provided in the request, the server
considers them insufficient to grant access. The client SHOULD NOT
automatically repeat the request with the same credentials. The client
MAY repeat the request with new or different credentials. However, a
request might be forbidden for reasons unrelated to the credentials.

An origin server that wishes to "hide" the current existence of a
forbidden target resource MAY instead respond with a status code of
[404 Not Found](/404).
