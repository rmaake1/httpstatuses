The target resource has more than one representation, each with its own
more specific identifier, and information about the alternatives is
being provided so that the user (or user agent) can select a preferred
representation by redirecting its request to one or more of those
identifiers.

In other words, the server desires that the user agent engage in
reactive negotiation to select the most appropriate representation(s)
for its needs<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

If the server has a preferred choice, the server SHOULD generate a
Location header field containing a preferred choice's URI reference. The
user agent MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection.

For request methods other than HEAD, the server SHOULD generate a
payload in the 300 response containing a list of representation metadata
and URI reference(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the
one most preferred. The user agent MAY make a selection from that list
automatically if it understands the provided media type. A specific
format for automatic selection is not defined by this specification
because HTTP tries to remain orthogonal to the definition of its
payloads. In practice, the representation is provided in some easily
parsed format believed to be acceptable to the user agent, as determined
by shared design or content negotiation, or in some commonly accepted
hypertext format.

A 300 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
by the method definition or explicit cache
controls<sup>[2](#ref-2)</sup>.

Note: The original proposal for the 300 status code defined the URI
header field as providing a list of alternative representations, such
that it would be usable for 200, 300, and 406 responses and be
transferred in responses to the HEAD method. However, lack of deployment
and disagreement over syntax led to both URI and Alternates (a
subsequent proposal) being dropped from this specification. It is
possible to communicate the list using a set of Link header
fields<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>, each with a relationship of "alternate",
though deployment is a chicken-and-egg problem.
