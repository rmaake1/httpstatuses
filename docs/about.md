[httpstatuses.github.io](https://httpstatuses.github.io) is an easy to reference database of HTTP
Status Codes with their definitions and helpful code references, each
code is at `httpstatuses.github.io/<code>` such as
[`httpstatuses.github.io/418`](/418). All standard codes are included, as
are some non-standard codes that have significant presence in the wild.

Previously, the project was known as `httpstatus.com`, but that site was
bought by a marketing firm and changed to promote their firm.
