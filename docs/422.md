The server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a
[415 Unsupported Media Type](/415) status code is inappropriate), and
the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a
[400 Bad Request](/400) status code is inappropriate) but was unable to
process the contained instructions.

For example, this error condition may occur if an XML request body
contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically
erroneous, XML instructions.
