The origin server did not find a current representation for the target
resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.

A 404 status code does not indicate whether this lack of representation
is temporary or permanent; the [410 Gone](/410) status code is preferred
over 404 if the origin server knows, presumably through some
configurable means, that the condition is likely to be permanent.

A 404 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
by the method definition or explicit cache
controls<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.
