The policy for accessing the resource has not been met in the request.
The server should send back all the information necessary for the client
to issue an extended request.

It is outside the scope of this specification to specify how the
extensions inform the client.

If the 510 response contains information about extensions that were not
present in the initial request then the client MAY repeat the request if
it has reason to believe it can fulfill the extension policy by
modifying the request according to the information provided in the 510
response. Otherwise the client MAY present any entity included in the
510 response to the user, since that entity may include relevant
diagnostic information.
