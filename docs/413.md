The server is refusing to process a request because the request payload
is larger than the server is willing or able to process.

The server MAY close the connection to prevent the client from
continuing the request.

If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD generate a Retry-After
header field to indicate that it is temporary and after what time the
client MAY try again.
