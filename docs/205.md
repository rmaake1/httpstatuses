The server has fulfilled the request and desires that the user agent
reset the "document view", which caused the request to be sent, to its
original state as received from the origin server.

This response is intended to support a common data entry use case where
the user receives content that supports data entry (a form, notepad,
canvas, etc.), enters or manipulates data in that space, causes the
entered data to be submitted in a request, and then the data entry
mechanism is reset for the next entry so that the user can easily
initiate another input action.

Since the 205 status code implies that no additional content will be
provided, a server MUST NOT generate a payload in a 205 response. In
other words, a server MUST do one of the following for a 205 response:
a) indicate a zero-length body for the response by including a
Content-Length header field with a value of 0; b) indicate a zero-length
payload for the response by including a Transfer-Encoding header field
with a value of chunked and a message body consisting of a single chunk
of zero-length; or, c) close the connection immediately after sending
the blank line terminating the header section.
