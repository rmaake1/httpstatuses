The server did not receive a complete request message within the time
that it was prepared to wait.

A server SHOULD send the "close" connection option<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>
in the response, since 408 implies that the server has decided to close
the connection rather than continue waiting. If the client has an
outstanding request in transit, the client MAY repeat that request on a
new connection.
